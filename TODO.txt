#   Adding batching for training (via Sequence keras class)
#   Shuffling training data in Sequence

#   Rewriting some logic concerning the switch from m21 to mido

#   SELECT SEQUENCE LENGTH DEPENDING ON MEAN AMOUNT OF EVENTS OF SCORES IN DATASET (i.e s1 has 10 event, s2 has 12 events, s3 has 11 events -> chose SEQUENCE_LENGTH as least third of mean(10,11,12) and smaller as smallest song?)
