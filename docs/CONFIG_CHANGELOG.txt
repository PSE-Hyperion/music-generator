CHANGELOG (julien)(04/08/2025):
    Pull request implementing new temperature tuple instead of single value needs entry of such type in config.

    Was already applied to all existing configs.


CHANGELOG (julien)(04/08/2025):
    Pull request for improved token maps includes a modified FEATURE_NAMES entry in configs. Now this is named FEATURES
    and contains (name, min value, max value, step) (could also contain temperature later). These values are used to generate
    complete token maps as defined in the FEATURES. This is also used to dynamically create NumericTuples in process.py and some plots.

    Is currently only present in config_julien.json.

CHANGELOG (almut)(16.08.2025)
    Pull request includes loss_weights in the config.
    The loss_weights consist of loss weights for bar, position, pitch, velocity, duration, and tempo.
    To make your code work you need a dictionary with each of these keys mapped to a numeric value.
    The loss_weights define how much each loss contributes to the overall training loss.

    loss_weights is currently present in config.json.
